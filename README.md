I am a fully-funded Master of Science & Engineering (MSE) student at [Princeton University's Computer Science Department](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/). 

I received a Bachelor of Science (BSc) degree in Honors Computer Science and Cybersecurity at the Tulane University, New Orleans. Upon my graduation I was inducted to the Phi Betta Kappa and Chi Alpha Sigma Honors Societies. 

My research experience spans computer architecture, operating and file systems, LLMs, ML/AI and cybersecurity policy. My current research interests are in **Algorithmic Decision-Making**, **AI and Education**, **Probability, Statistics and Machine Learning**, and **Data Science**.

## Projects
**Honors Thesis: "Enhancing Teaching Methods of File Systems from the Educational Perspective"** [[Paper]] (https://library.search.tulane.edu/permalink/01TUL_INST/1jgl1pd/alma9945574993306326)\
![File Systems Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/File%20Systems-green) ![Computer Science Education](https://img.shields.io/badge/Computer%20Science%20Education-red)
- Explored collaborative filtering (CF)-based recommender systems for personalizing question selection in computer-based assessments by predicting student performance on new, unseen questions using past scores.

**Predictive Models for Cyber Threat Trend Analysis** [[Code]](https://github.com/Sof0-0/CyberAttacks.github.io) [[Paper]](https://sof0-0.github.io/CyberAttacks.github.io/)\
![Data Science Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/DataScience-blue) ![Cybersecurity Badge] (https://img.shields.io/badge/Cybersecurity-purple)
- Developed two mixed precision variants of the Minimal Residual (MINRES) method for solving sparse saddle-point linear systems, allowing users to adjust the precision of preconditioner solves and matrix-vector products.

**MIPS R4000 Simulator for an 8-Stage Pipeline** [[Code]](https://github.com/Sof0-0/MIPS-R4000)
![Computer Architecture Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Computer%20Architecture-pink) 
- Analyzed the effects of four low precision training schemes on both the training time and classification accuracy of four deep learning models from the domains of image and text classification.

**RISC-V Disassembler** [[Code]](https://github.com/Sof0-0/RISC-V-Disassembler)
![Computer Architecture Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Computer%20Architecture-pink) 
- Conducted a thematic analysis of computer-based assessment questions in undergraduate CS courses to investigate how instructors integrate randomization into their assessment questions.
